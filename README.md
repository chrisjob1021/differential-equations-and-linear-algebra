# Differential Equations and Linear Algebra - Graphical Examples

This repository contains Python implementations of some graphical examples discussed in Gilbert Strang's "Differential Equations and Linear Algebra" textbook. 

## Examples Included

1. **Newton's Method with Complex Roots**
   - Demonstrates chaos in iterative root finding
   - Shows how real sequences cannot approach imaginary roots

2. **HÃ©non Map**
   - Classic example of a discrete-time chaotic system
   - Visualizes the Strange Attractor

3. **Lorenz System**
   - Famous atmospheric convection model
   - Shows chaos in a continuous-time system

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
